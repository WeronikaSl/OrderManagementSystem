# OrderManagementSystem

## Description
OrderManagementSystem is a C++ application that allows users to manage inventory data, customer data and orders. Users can perform operations such as adding, updating, deleting and retrieving data from the database. Additionally, the application supports generating XML files containing retrieved data.

## Project created to practice:
1. C++ application and classes design (such as creating abstraction or minimizing dependencies among classes)
2. Integrating databases with C++ applications (using Oracle Database Express Edition (XE))
3. XML handling in C++ (using XmlLite library by Microsoft)

Validation of user console input and exception handling has already been practiced in other projects. It's not something I want to focus on practicing here, so it has intentionally not been implemented.
